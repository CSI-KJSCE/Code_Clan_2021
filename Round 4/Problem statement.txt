CSI organized a competitive offline hands-on event at college for Abhiyantriki event. At the end of each session, participants were given 
tasks to check their understanding and fun. For simplicity of participants, they were free to 
complete the task alone or they can form a group with any number of people they want.

Consider the sitting arrangements to be in the form of matrix MxN . Each group member is denoted as 1 and the places/spaces which
remain unoccupied are marked as 0. For fair results, No two groups are adjacent, meaning participant in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another participant in a different group.

Since there are a lot of participants, it would be easy if the CSI members knew the locations [co-ordinates] of each group.
Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right member of each group. A group  with a top left member at (r1, c1) and a bottom right member at (r2, c2) is represented by the 4-length array [r1, c1, r2, c2].

Return a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each group of participants. If there are no groups , return an empty array. You may return the answer in any order.

Input: sitting arrangement = [[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]
Explanation:
The first group has a top left corner at matrix[0][0] and a bottom right corner at matrix[0][0].
The second group has a top left corner at matrix[1][1] and a bottom right corner at matrix[2][2].
